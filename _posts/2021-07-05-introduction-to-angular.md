## Introduction

Hello, I am Snail. Just join there about a week. I am here to share about Angular.

Why I choose to talk about Angular as my first series is because it is the first framework I have ever learnt in my school. And I love its well-structured working trees and it works with MVC model, which I think is the easiest software architecture to adapt with.

This post will first talk about the basic, such as the basic info about Angular, the prerequisites of getting started with the framework. Then go through the intermediates, for example, components, directives, form validations and Routings. It will include useful cheatsheet or using with some third-party libraries such as Plotly, Firebase, etc.

## ATTENTION

I am not a native English speaker or writer, so there may be spelling or grammer mistakes. Also, please feel free to comment below :)

## Basic Info

Angular is developed and maintained by Google, and is a framework which is specialized on building single page application in MVC approach.

## Prerequisites

Before jumping into Angular, make sure you have acquired the following:

For the programming language, you must know:

1.  **TypeScript(TS)**. As Angular's scripting language is TypeScript. So you better have a picture of its concepts and syntaxes.

2.  **JavaScript(JS)**. Although Angular uses TS as its scripting language, TS is based on JS while TS put much emphasis on types. Also, some built-in classes, such as Date and Array in TS works as the same way as JS.

3.  **HTML**. No need to mention, it is the most essential elements for building Angular's UI.

4.  **Stylesheets**. The reasons of why I am not going to mention which stylesheet will be needed for Angular is that Angular support many kinds of stylesheets, including CSS, SASS, LESS, etc.

For installation, you must have the following:

1.  **NPM**. You have to install this before you install Angular.

2.  **Node.js**. You need to install this as this can install NPM for you by default.

## Installation

To install it, just typ the following:
npm i -g @angular/cli
You will need to add sudo if you are usig Linux and your user account does not have root permission.

Ok, we have installed the Angular, then we are going through the elements in Angular in the next part.
