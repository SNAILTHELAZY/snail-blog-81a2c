**Snail** *is a developer who live in Hong Kong. Although being a developer, Snail is lack of experiences of developing a game or web.*

*They start to learn coding in 2017, as well as learning to develop a game, then learn web development after 2 years of higher diploma educations.*

*However, because of the covid-19 and the social environment in Hong Kong, it is more difficult to get a job. Thus, Snail decided to make a blog to revise and share knowledge of what they have learnt in both web development and game development. As well as to earn a living.*
